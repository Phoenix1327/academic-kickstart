I am currently a senior research engineer at the Platform & Content Group (PCG) in Tencent Inc.

Before that, I received my PhD degree in Pattern Recognition and Intelligent System from [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)](http://english.ia.cas.cn) in 2019 advised by [Kaiqi Huang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=caQ-OmYAAAAJ) and my bachelor degree in Automation from [Department of Automation, Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/auen/) in 2014.

My previous research interests include image object classification/detection, zero/few-shot learning and weakly/semi supervised learning. My current work focuses on video-based recogntion task, such as action recognition and video understanding.
